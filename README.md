# DRComputerScienceJourney

My Journey to Learn Computer Science from Developer Roadmaps provided by roadmap.sh. https://roadmap.sh/computer-science

## This learning path provides free resources for

A self-taught developer.

## Coverage

- Core programming concepts: This includes knowledge of data structures such as tries, balanced search trees, K-D trees, and skip lists. It also involves understanding basic math skills, bitwise operators, floating-point numbers, character encodings, and string search/manipulation techniques.

- Algorithmic analysis and efficiency: Familiarity with asymptotic notation and complexity classes is crucial to evaluate and compare the efficiency of algorithms. It allows you to understand the performance characteristics of common algorithms and make informed decisions when designing or optimizing code.

- Software engineering and system design: This encompasses various areas such as common UML diagrams, design patterns, system design principles, process and threads management, and how computers work at a fundamental level. Additionally, it includes knowledge of databases, networking, security, and an understanding of how to design scalable and robust systems.
